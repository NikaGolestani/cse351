### **Purpose and Functionality**

The code implements a lexer and parser for a simple intermediate language (IL) designed to support arithmetic expressions and assignment operations. Using **Flex** for tokenizing input and **Bison** for parsing and syntax analysis, the program efficiently handles variable assignments, arithmetic computations, and basic optimizations while maintaining a symbol table to track variables and their values.

### **Components and Features**

#### **1. Lexer (Flex Component)**

- **Objective**: To tokenize the input stream into recognizable components (tokens) such as variables, constants, operators, and delimiters for the parser.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Identifiers**: Recognized using the pattern `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.
  - **Numeric Constants**: Matches sequences of digits `[0-9]+`.
  - **Operators**: Detects `=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^` for assignments and arithmetic expressions.
  - **Delimiters**: Recognizes `;` to indicate the end of a statement.
  - **Line Number Tracking**: Tracks and increments line numbers for debugging and error reporting.
  - **Whitespace and Errors**: Ignores unrecognized characters and whitespace.

#### **2. Parser (Bison Component)**

- **Objective**: To parse tokens from the lexer, evaluate expressions, execute assignments, and optimize the intermediate code through simplification and constant folding.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Symbol Table Management**:
    - Utilizes an `unordered_map<string, item>` to store and manage identifiers and constants.
    - Each `item` comprises:
      - `is_constant`: Boolean flag indicating if the variable holds a constant value.
      - `value`: Stores the numeric value or ASCII representation.
    - Handles uninitialized variables by assigning their ASCII value.
  - **Expression Evaluation**:
    - **Addition and Subtraction**:
      - Simplifies expressions like `x + 0` or `x - 0`.
      - Performs constant folding for purely numeric operations.
    - **Multiplication and Division**:
      - Optimizes cases such as `x * 1`, `x * 0`, and `1 * x`.
      - Handles division carefully, ensuring no division by zero.
    - **Exponentiation**:
      - Simplifies common scenarios, e.g., `x^1` or `x^2`.
      - Computes numeric results using `pow()` for constant expressions.
  - **Assignments**:
    - Variables are assigned computed values or identifiers are stored as is.
    - Supports propagation of constants and identifiers to streamline code.

### **Implementation Details**

1. **Lexer-Parser Interaction**:

   - The lexer identifies tokens and passes them to the parser.
   - `yylval` is used to transfer token-specific values (e.g., numeric values or variable names).

2. **Symbol Table Updates**:

   - Each assignment updates the symbol table with the computed result or a reference to another variable.
   - Default values (ASCII representations) are assigned to undefined variables.

3. **Optimization Techniques**:

   - **Constant Folding**: Computes operations on numeric constants at compile time (e.g., `x = 3 + 5` becomes `x = 8`).
   - **Simplification**: Eliminates redundant expressions (e.g., `x + 0`, `x * 1`) and substitutes equivalent operations (e.g., `y^2` to `y * y`).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Detects and reports division by zero.
   - Handles unexpected tokens gracefully, continuing to process valid input.

### **Conclusion**

The implementation efficiently processes and optimizes intermediate code by combining robust lexing, parsing, and expression simplification techniques. Its support for constant folding, algebraic simplifications, and symbol table management provides a strong foundation for further enhancements to the intermediate language. Prioritizing the evaluation of `x` as the last operator highlights the emphasis on reducing unnecessary calculations and improving the robustness of arithmetic optimizations.
